# üé® Color Detection Model
Welcome to the Color Detection Model! This project allows you to identify the closest color name to a given pixel in an image. It‚Äôs an essential tool for designers, developers, and anyone working with digital media who needs to extract color information from images.

# üì∏ Demo
Check out how the model works! Upload an image, and the model will return the color name for any pixel you select.



# üöÄ Features
Real-time color detection: Instantly get the color name from any pixel in your image.
Supports multiple image formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, and more.
User-friendly interface: Intuitive UI to easily upload images and select pixels.
High accuracy: Matches colors to a comprehensive color database.
Scalable: Can handle high-resolution images with ease.
üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Get started with the color detection model in just a few steps!

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need the following libraries:


pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
Clone the Repository
#
git clone https://github.com/abhinavyadav11/colordetection.git

cd colordetectionmodel

Run the Model
#
Download the model to use it
model : https://github.com/abhinavyadav11/ColorDetection/blob/main/color_classification_model.h5
#
# üìù How It Works
Load the Image: The model takes an image as input.
Pixel Selection: You can click on any pixel in the image to detect its color.
Color Matching: The model matches the RGB value of the pixel to the nearest named color in a predefined color database.
Display Result: The detected color name is displayed on the interface.
Color Database
The model uses a color database containing over 1000 named colors, ensuring accurate color detection across a wide spectrum.

# Code
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np


color_model = load_model('/Users/abhinavyadav/Downloads/KaggleModel/color_classification_model.h5')

# Load and preprocess the image
img_path = '/Users/abhinavyadav/Downloads/KaggleTesting/light-orange-color-wall-texture.jpeg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(64, 64))  # Adjust size as needed
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
img_array = img_array / 255.0  # Normalize if needed



# Make predictions
predictions = color_model.predict(img_array)

# If you have a classification model
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions[0])

# For classification: map the predicted class to a label
class_labels = ['black', 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'grey', 'orange', 'red', 'violet', 'white', 'yellow']  # Replace with your actual class labels
predicted_label = class_labels[predicted_class]
print(f'Predicted Label: {predicted_label}')


# üñ•Ô∏è Usage
You can use this model in your own projects, such as:

Web development: Integrate color detection into your web apps.
Graphic design: Automatically extract and name colors from design assets.
Photography: Identify and use specific colors in your photos.
Web Integration Example
You can easily integrate this model into your web applications using Flask or Django:



üí° Tips for Best Results
Ensure that the images have good lighting to get the most accurate color detection.
When dealing with gradients or mixed colors, the model will return the most dominant color in the pixel.
